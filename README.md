# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Variable Speed Limit Control

This repository contains an implementation of a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system for Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control, based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08021

## Overview

This implementation is designed for a journal club discussion of the above paper. It provides a Python-based simulation environment and MARL algorithm to explore the concepts and techniques described in the paper for VSL control on freeways.


## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Installation
Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

To run the training process:

```
poetry run python main.py
```

This will start the training process and log results to Wandb.
